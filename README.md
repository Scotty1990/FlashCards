# Simpsons Matching Flash Cards
In the project I created cards that the user can click in order to flip. If they match, the program knows to add to the score. The user can switch between single player and two player.

### Technologies used
- HTML
- Javascript
- CSS

### Challenges Overcome
- Making use of ```.classList.toggle```
- Making the conditionals for when the user clicks on the same card twice in a row
- Using ```.setTimeout``` effectively and making sure the code executed in the proper order
- Using ```.addEventListener``` for the input text box and having the program be able to differentiate between when it was one player or two players
- Making sure players couldn't flip more than two cards at once and made sure they couldn't flip the card they just flipped up back down.
- Getting the reset button to work for all situations
